# Hotel-Reservation-Cancellations-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-with-ML-Algorithms

1.1 Overview

Hotel Reservation Cancellations Data Analysis and Prediction is a project that aims to
identify the factors that contribute to reservation cancellations for a City Hotel and a
Resort Hotel. This project involves analyzing a dataset of booking information, testing
hypotheses related to the pricing and the day of the week, and developing predictive
models to make predictions about future cancellations. The primary objective of this
project is to provide insights into the factors that lead to reservation cancellations and
to develop strategies that can help both hotels reduce the number of cancellations. By
analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns and trends in the data, this project can help
both hotels to improve their revenue generation and operational efficiency. To achieve
these goals, the project will involve a thorough analysis of the dataset, including the
use of statistical techniques and data visualization tools. Additionally, the project will
involve the development of predictive models, which can help both hotels to anticipate
cancellations and take proactive measures to prevent them.
Overall, this project represents a comprehensive analysis of hotel reservation cancellations and aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations to help both City
Hotel and Resort Hotel reduce cancellations, improve their revenue generation, and operate more efficiently.

1.2 Motivation

There are several compelling reasons why the Hotel Reservation Cancellations Data
Analysis and Prediction project is important and worth pursuing:
• The project aims to help City Hotel and Resort Hotel to reduce cancellations,
improve their revenue generation, and operate more efficiently.
• By identifying the factors that contribute to cancellations, this project can provide valuable insights that can inform pricing, promotions, and other business
decisions.

• The project also involves developing predictive models to anticipate cancellations, which can help the hotels to better manage their resources and staffing.
• Reducing cancellations can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, as
well as positive word-of-mouth recommendations.
• The insights and recommendations generated by this project can have broader
applications in the hospitality industry, making it a valuable contribution to the
field.

1.3 Problem Definition

1.3.1 Problem Definition

The Hotel Reservation Cancellations Data Analysis and Prediction project aims to address the problem of high cancellation rates in the hospitality industry. The project
involves analyzing data from two hotels to identify factors that contribute to cancellations and developing predictive models to anticipate cancellations, thereby reducing
revenue losses and improving operational efficiency.

1.3.2 Problem Statement

The hospitality industry faces a significant challenge with high rates of hotel reservation cancellations, resulting in lost revenue and operational inefficiencies. The Hotel
Reservation Cancellations Data Analysis and Prediction project aims to address this
problem by analyzing reservation data from City Hotel and Resort Hotel to identify
the factors that contribute to cancellations and developing predictive models to anticipate cancellations. The project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations
to help the hotels reduce cancellations, improve their revenue generation, and operate
more efficiently. elaborate this and make it professional
